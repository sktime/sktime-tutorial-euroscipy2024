    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frequently, specific needs appear in the industry. A problem appears, and technical proposals are made to solve the issue (preprocessing steps, models, etc.)\n",
    "- The data scientists need to be able to test these hypothesis - how to do it without needing to code everything from scratch?\n",
    "- Sktime pipelines provide a safe way to benchmark preprocessing steps, avoiding data leakage and other common pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Sktime is not only a library for industry, but also for research.\n",
    "When developing a new method, the researcher is usually interest in\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ability to test new ideas quickly\n",
    "* Reproducibility of the method by new users and peers\n",
    "* Comparison with other models and ideas\n",

    "## Why customizing with sktime?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**: productivity, scalability, reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "* Out-of-the-box compatibility with the sktime ecosystem and the hundred models available\n",
    "* You implement one model -> get multivariate forecasting, tuning strategies, cross validation implementation,  for free\n",
    "* For free: vectorization for multivariate forecasting, tuning strategies, cross validation implementation, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "If a sktime estimator is developed, it can be plugged-in into the sktime ecosystem, and be compared with other models in a fair way.\n",
